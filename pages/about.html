  Hi, I'm Debjit Mandal, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Kalinga Institute of
  Industrial Technology, Bhubaneswar, Odisha, India. <br> <br> I have a passion for coding and I'm always looking to
  improve my skills and knowledge. During my studies, I have gained experience in a variety of programming languages and
  tools, including Java, Python, C/C++, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Rust, and Go. I have also worked on various projects both
  individually and as part of a team, which have helped me develop my skills in problem-solving, collaboration, and
  project management. <br> <br> Aside from programming, I enjoy reading about new technologies and attending tech events
  to learn from industry experts and network with like-minded Individuals.
